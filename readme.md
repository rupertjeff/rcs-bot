# RCS Bot

Discord bot for [RandomCS](http://randomcs.com).

## ToDo List

* [ ] Roster Changes in Battlefy (Team wants to add a player to their roster, can only be done by RCS denoted Battlefy admin due to Battlefy issue)
* [ ] Post RCS defined messages at RCS defined intervals in Discord channels
* [ ] Store results in database for easier RCS consumption
